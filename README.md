# Insurance_fraud_detection
This project develops a machine learning system to detect fraudulent insurance claims. Using a dataset of 1,000 historical claims, we built and optimized a Random Forest classifier that achieves 91% ROC-AUC in identifying suspicious claims. The solution helps insurers reduce financial losses by flagging high-risk claims for investigation.
